# Task-related Component Analysis(TRCA)

a data analysis technique

neuroscience & ML

useful dealing with multi dimensional data or signals

extract & analyze components of the data that are specifically related to a given task or stimulus, while filtering out irrelevant or noise-related components.

by comparing the responses of multiple sensors or channels to different task conditions or stimuli and identifying common patterns or components that are task-related.

## Features

- Noise Reduction: One of the advantages of TRCA is its ability to suppress noise and extract task-related information, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where the signal-to-noise ratio is low.
- Discriminative Power: TRCA is designed to enhance the discriminative power of the extracted components, making it easier to distinguish between different task-related conditions or stimuli.
- Multivariate Analysis: TRCA typically involves the simultaneous analysis of multiple data channels or sensors. This multivariate approach allows it to capture complex relationships between different components of the data.
